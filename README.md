## General Information
- A TUI based RSA cracker tool
- Made to show how bad it is to have a prime modulo in an RSA cryptosystem


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.11.3
- cryptography - version 40.0.2


## Features
- Tonelli-Shanks algorithm implemented (Special thanks to [ZeroBone](https://zerobone.net/blog/math/tonelli-shanks/))
- Quadratic-Residue algorithm implemented


## Screenshots

## Setup
Make sure all requirements are installed in your local machine beforehand.

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

Then, clone this repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sozyGithub/Tubes2_bebas.git
```

Change to the repository directory, then run the `main.py` file.

```bash
python src/main.py
```
